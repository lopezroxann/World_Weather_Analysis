# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose

We are assisting users on the PlanMyTrip search and plan their trip based on their desired weather conditions. We query the users to input their desired minimum and maximum temperatures and the system will generate cities around the globe. Not only will PlanMyTrip display the temperature, but will also show you the nearest hotel as shown below:

PlanMyTrip can also assist users in planning their route if they are looking to visit more than one city. In the image below, we show the driving route between four different cities in Mexico:
